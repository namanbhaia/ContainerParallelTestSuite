# Container Parallel Test Suite (CoPTS)
CoPTS provides an extensible benchmarking suite implemented using Bash and Python to automate orchestration of parallel benchmark runs across different container runtimes. 
This tool supports:
A. Running multiple benchmarks:
	1. Bonnie++
	2. Linpack
	3. Noploop
 	4. Stream
    5. Sysbench
    6. Unixbench
    7. Y-Cruncher
B. Execution of benchmarks as Docker containers on OCI compatible runtimes including
    1. runc (Docker)
    2. runsc (gVisor)
    3. crun
    4. Kata 1.0
    5. runnc (Nabla)
C. Configurable options to specify: 
    1. Benchmark to run
    2. Distribution of benchmark runs

Tool Configurations:
1. Benchmark to use:
2. Distribution of benchmark runs
	2.1. Parallel Processes:
   		Parallel testing is achieved by having multiple processes create and execute containers in parallel on the same host.
   	2.2. Number of containers launched:
   	2.3. Number runs of each iteratoin:

The design of CoPTS is extensible so that new benchmarks or container runtimes can be added. 
CoPTS aggregates key performance indicators generated by benchmarks (e.g. runtime or throughput) into a tabular format to enhance readability. For each run, CoPTS generates ‘x+1’ CSV files: 
	• 1 file from each of the ‘x’ parallel processes aggregating all benchmark iterations within it 
 	• 1 file that aggregates the runs from all the parallel process. 

Example:
For example, to orchestrate running the STREAM benchmark, CoPTS can be configured to create 40 processes which each launch a container 20times sequentially. Then for each container CoPTS runs STREAM 10 times. 
CoPTS then generates 40 files summarizing output from each process to aggregate results from (20x10=200) runs. 
A finaloutput file is then produced to aggregate results from all 40 processes to capture results for all (40x20=8,000) runs.
